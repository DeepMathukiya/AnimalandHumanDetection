# Why Open Images Dataset is Ideal for Retraining YOLO Models

The **Open Images Dataset** is a powerful and comprehensive resource curated by Google, containing millions of labeled images spanning thousands of object categories. It is particularly well-suited for **retraining YOLO (You Only Look Once)** models â€” one of the fastest and most accurate object detection algorithms â€” due to its scale, diversity, and detailed annotations.
